HARDLIMIT = 30  # Previous HL is 25   ::::: Absolute LTP difference for finding OPTIMAL OPTION   e.g. if nearest_price is 100, we want an option with LTP between 75 and 125. If no option is found in this range, we skip the trade. This prevents taking trades with very high premium difference which may not be ideal for our strategy.
